View Repos
- gh repos list
- gh repos list username
- curl "https://api.github.com/users/spiderman/repos" |grep "ssh_url"
  - this is ugly and doesn't show hidden ones and I'd rather just not use it. there's a better way but I don't really want to mess with it

Clone Repo
- git clone https://github.com/spiderman/repository-name.git
- gh repo clone rymann22/repo_Name

Editing Repo
- cd repository-name
- vi file or whatever you want

View status of modified files
- git status

Stage files you want to commit "save"
- this is kind of like "getting them ready" for the next "permanent" save which would be the commit. This allows you to edit stuff again and review anything you need to
  - add all files
    - git add .
  - add one file
    - git add file_name.txt

Commit chanages "add comments"
- permanent snapshot of changes. It's basically a new version everytime you commit changes
  - git commit -m "updated file_name.txt with whatever"

Push changes to github
- this pushes everything to your actual github repo
  - git push origin main
    - note: main might not be the name of the branch, so double check it 

Branches
- edit specific parts of a project separate from the "main" branch

spiderman@computer$ git init
  - This creates a .git folder in your current directory
